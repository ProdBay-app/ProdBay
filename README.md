## Getting Started
## Deploying to Railway

1. Push your repo to GitHub/GitLab.
2. In Railway, create a New Project â†’ Deploy from Repo â†’ select this repo.
3. Configure variables in Railway â†’ Variables:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - Optional `PORT` (Railway provides one; our start script reads it)
4. Build & start commands (Railway auto-detects):
   - Build: `npm run build`
   - Start: `npm run start`
5. Set Node version (Project Settings â†’ Environment): Node 18+ is required (we declare `engines.node >=18`).
6. Apply database schema in your Supabase project using the SQL in `supabase/migrations/20250820125716_crimson_disk.sql`.
7. Deploy. Railway will serve the static build via Vite preview.
 
Notes:
- The app requires valid Supabase vars at build time. Ensure variables are present in Railway before the first deployment.
- Default port is taken from `PORT` env; our script falls back to 4174 for local runs.


### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (recommend 20 LTS)
- Supabase account (hosted) or Supabase CLI for local

### Setup

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   - Create a Supabase project (dashboard) OR run `supabase start` (CLI) for local
   - Apply schema from `supabase/migrations/20250820125716_crimson_disk.sql` using the SQL editor or CLI

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Copy one of the examples and fill in your values
   ```bash
   # local dev
   cp env.local.example .env.local
   # production build preview
   cp env.production.example .env.production
   ```
   Required keys (Vite will expose only `VITE_` prefixed):
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

4. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # http://localhost:5173
   ```

5. **Production build and local preview**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   # default: http://localhost:4174 (set PORT=xxxx to override)
   ```

### Troubleshooting blank page after build
- Ensure `.env.production` exists and contains valid `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` before running `npm run build`.
- Check DevTools Console for messages starting with `[Supabase]` indicating missing env.
- Rebuild after setting envs.

## Automated Workflows

### Project Creation Flow
1. Client submits project brief
2. System automatically parses brief to identify required assets
3. Assets are created in database with specifications
4. Relevant suppliers are identified based on service categories

### Quote Request Flow
1. Producer reviews assets and clicks "Send to Suppliers"
2. System automatically emails relevant suppliers with quote requests
3. Each supplier receives unique link with project details
4. Quotes are collected and organized for producer review

### Quote Acceptance Flow
1. Producer reviews submitted quotes
2. Accepts best quote for each asset
3. System automatically assigns supplier to asset
4. Other quotes for same asset are rejected
5. Project status updates based on asset progress

## User Journey

### For Producers  
1. Access `/producer/dashboard` to view all projects
2. Review automatically created assets
3. Manage supplier network at `/producer/suppliers`
4. Send quote requests and review submissions
5. Accept quotes and track project progress

### For Suppliers
1. Access `/supplier/quotes` to view quotes you have submitted
2. Use `/supplier/submit` to upload a new quote for an asset
3. Alternatively, follow unique email links to submit quotes for specific requests

## Key Automation Features

- **Asset Parsing**: Automatically identifies printing, staging, audio, lighting, catering, transport, and design requirements from project briefs
- **Supplier Matching**: Matches suppliers to assets based on service category alignment
- **Email Generation**: Creates personalized quote request emails with project context
- **Status Tracking**: Updates project and asset statuses based on quote acceptances
- **Real-time Updates**: Synchronizes data across all user interfaces
