feat(supplier): enable PDF file uploads for quotes

Adds complete file upload functionality to the supplier quote portal,
allowing suppliers to attach PDF documents when submitting quotes.

Database Changes:
- Add `quote_document_url` column to `quotes` table
- Create `quote-attachments` public storage bucket (10MB limit, PDF only)
- Configure RLS policies for public uploads, reads, updates, and deletes
- Add index on `quote_document_url` for performance

Backend Changes:
- Update `submitQuoteViaPortal` to save `quote_document_url` when provided
- Remove TODO comment and enable file URL persistence

Frontend Changes:
- Implement file selection with validation (PDF only, 10MB max)
- Add `uploadFile` function using Supabase Storage client
- Wire file upload into quote submission flow
- Add file preview with remove option before submission
- Display file link in success summary
- Add upload progress indicators

TypeScript Updates:
- Add `quote_document_url?: string` to Quote interfaces in:
  - src/lib/supabase.ts
  - src/types/database.ts
  - src/services/portalService.ts

Storage Configuration:
- Public bucket: `quote-attachments`
- File path: `public/quote-{quoteId}-{timestamp}.pdf`
- MIME type restriction: application/pdf
- Size limit: 10MB

Security:
- Public bucket with path-based access control
- RLS policies restrict uploads to `public/` folder
- Anonymous users can upload/read via access_token validation

Testing:
- File validation (type and size)
- Upload to Supabase Storage
- URL generation and database persistence
- Error handling for upload failures

This completes the supplier portal quote submission flow, enabling
suppliers to attach formal quote documents alongside price and notes.
